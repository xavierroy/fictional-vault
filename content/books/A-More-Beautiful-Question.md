# A More Beautiful Question by Warren Berger

## Summary

You don't learn unless you question. Asking the right questions, we can be innovative and creative and be successful in our endeavors. 

## Review

I came across **A More Beautiful Question by Warren Berger** in The Knowledge Project [podcast](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/warren-berger/). I was intrigued by this - a book that is about questions. And there was this statement in there that said, *You don't learn unless you question*. So off went the book to my TBR shelf.

According to Warren Berger, the more beautiful questions we ask, the more better answers we get.

He defines a beautiful question as: 
>"_an ambitious yet actionable question that can begin to shift the way we perceive or think about somethingâ€”and that might serve as a catalyst to bring about change_."

He provides a lot of stories about innovations that came about as a result of someone asking a beautiful question.

- *Why should I have to pay these late fees?* (the question behind **Netflix**). 
- *Why do we have to wait for the picture?* (the question that led to **Polaroid**)
- *Why arenâ€™t the players urinating more?* (the question that led to **Gatorade**)

To get us in that mode on inquiry, he describes a three-part *Whyâ€“What Ifâ€“How* model for forming and tackling big, beautiful questions:

- The **Why?** and its counterpart, **Why Not?** helps us in seeking understanding about a situation or a problem.
- The **What If?** question allows us to imagine possibilities.
- The **How?** question allows figuring out and making one or more of the possibilities a reality.

I felt that this model makes perfect sense to me and questioning or contextual inquiry is at the core of the [[Design Thinking]] process. 

And what is a book about questions without some questions? Berger has peppered the chapters with around 370 questions and has collected them all as part of a Question Index which I felt was a great idea. *If facts are entitled to an index, then why not questions?*

As someone who likes questions a lot, this book explains the process of thinking behind the questions lucidly.

As I read this book, I started coming up with a set of questions that I want to keep asking myself. And I want to work through them to understand and come up with answers.  and also try thinking and answering some of the questions that Berger has asked.

- *In a world that expects us to move fast, to keep advancing, and to just â€˜get it done,â€™ who has time for asking why?*
  - Most of the times, our impulse is to keep plowing ahead, doing what weâ€™ve done, and rarely stepping back to question whether weâ€™re on the right path.
- *What if you sleep with a question? Will you wake with an answer?*
  - This is an interesting question and one that I plan to experiment with. 
- *What if a job interview tested oneâ€™s ability to ask questions, as well as answer them?*
  - We've heard the standard question: *Do you have any questions for us?* from the interview panel. Some jump at it and some don't. This is an interesting question to me as I am involved in interviewing people for my team. How do I test if people have the ability to question? How do I draw out that ability?

This book reminded me of Randall Munroe's [What If](https://what-if.xkcd.com/book/), a  book that answers absurd hypothetical scientific answers. One question in that book was: *What would happen if you tried to fly a normal Earth airplane above different solar system bodies?* Well now we know the answer to that with [Ingenuity](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/). ðŸ™‚
