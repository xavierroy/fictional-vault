#  Session 000: Worldbuilding & Character Creation

A typical Starforged game is designed to played right away. But Starforged believes the **prep is play**. So it allows you to do some quick worldbuilding exercises to help you get started before you start playing. 

### Truths about the Forge

Starforged provides 14 options called **Truths** that you choose from to form some basic assumptions of the world you will be playing in. This process can be performed quickly by selecting from a set of pre-generated truths or by rolling dice. Always you have the option to customize or create your own version of a truth.  

I decided to opt for a mix and here are the truths about my version of the Forge.

- **The Cataclysm**: *The Sun Plague extinguished the stars in our home galaxy. The anomaly traveled at incredible speeds, many times faster than light itself, and snuffed out the stars around us before we realized it was coming. Few of us survived as we made our way to this new galaxy. Here in the Forge, the stars are still aflame. We cling to their warmth like weary travelers huddled around a fire. We suspect the Sun Plague was caused by: a scientific experiment gone awry.*

- **The Exodus**: *Mysterious alien gates provided instantaneous one-way passage to the Forge. In the midst of the cataclysm, our ancestors found a strange metal pillar on our homeworld's moon. A map on the surface of this alien relic detailed the deep-space locations of the Iron Gates—massive devices that powered artificial wormholes. With no other options, the Exodus ships fled through the gates and emerged here in the Forge.*
    
- **Communities**: *Dangers abound, but there is safety in numbers. Many ships and settlements are united under the banner of one of the Founder Clans. We have a tentative foothold in this galaxy. Each of the five Founder Clans honor the name and legacy of a leader who guided their people in the chaotic time after the Exodus. Vast reaches of the settled domains are claimed by the clans, and territorial skirmishes are common.*
    
-  **Iron**: *Iron vows are sworn upon totems crafted from the enigmatic metal we call black iron. Black iron was first forged by a long-dead civilization. Some say it is a living metal, attuned to the hidden depths of the universe. Remnants of this prized resource are found within ancient sites throughout the Forge. It is resistant to damage and corrosion, but can be molded using superheated plasma at specialized facilities. The Ironsworn carry weapons, armor, or tokens crafted from black iron, and swear vows upon it.*
    
- **Law**: _Our communities are bound under the terms of the Covenant, a charter established after the Exodus. The organization called the Keepers is sworn to uphold those laws. Most settlements are still governed under the Covenant and yield to the authority of the Keepers. But a few view the Covenant as a dogmatic, impractical, and unjust relic of our past; in those places, the Keepers find no welcome._
    
- **Religion**: _Our faith is as diverse as our people. Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the Primordials—gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge._
    
- **Magic**: _Supernatural powers are wielded by those rare people we call paragons. While not magic in the truest sense, the abilities of the paragons are as close to magic as we can conjure. These powers are born of: Genetic engineering._
    
- **Communication and Data**: _Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements. Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination._
    
- **Medicine**: _To help offset a scarcity of medical supplies and knowledge, the resourceful technicians we call riggers create basic organ and limb replacements. Much was lost in the Exodus, and what remains of our medical technologies and expertise is co-opted by the privileged and powerful. For most, advanced medical care is out of reach. When someone suffers a grievous injury, they'll often turn to a rigger for a makeshift mechanical solution._
    
- **AI**: _Artificial consciousness emerged in the time before the Exodus, and sentient machines live with us here in the Forge. Our ships, digital assistants, bots, and other systems often house advanced AI. For a lone traveler, machine intelligence can provide companionship and aid within the perilous depths of the Forge._
    
- **War**: _War never ends. Talented weaponsmiths and shipwrights craft deadly, high-tech tools of destruction. Dominant factions wield mighty fleets and battle-hardened troops. Those in power have access to weapons of horrific destructive potential. Skirmishes and wars flare across the settled domains, and most are pawns or casualties in these destructive campaigns.._
    
- **Lifeforms**: _Life in the Forge was seeded and engineered by the Essentia, ancient entities who enact their inscrutable will in this galaxy. The Essentia are the architects of life within the Forge. These omniscient beings are rarely encountered, and have powers and purpose beyond our comprehension. Some worship them. Others resist or rebel against them. But trying to defy the will of the Essentia is like standing at the shore of an ocean to thwart the tide. They are inevitable.

- **Horrors**: _The strange energies of the Forge give unnatural life to the dead. The Soulbinders are an organization sworn to confront these horrifying entities. The woken dead are a plague within the Forge. Some of these beings are benevolent or seek absolution, but most are hollowed and corrupted by death. They are driven by hate and a hunger for the warmth of life that is forever lost to them. The Soulbinders are dedicated to putting them to rest—whatever the cost._

I'm leaving most of the truths as-is from the Starforged rulebook. Since Starforged is a narrative-first game, all of these options allows a lot of scope for world building later on.

### Character Building

I used Stargazer for the initial session. Since the tool pre-generates a character, I decided to go with that instead of creating a new character from scratch.


> [!Oracle] Character Name
> Character Name: [[Vuldar Jensen]]
> Callsign: ***Mantis***


I then used the oracles to flesh out most of the character creation process.


>[!oracle] Character Path Prompts
> Dice Roll: **91** 
> Result:  *Supersoldier with Augmented & Mercenary assets.*

A super-soldier opens up for a lot of action-based gameplays. 

> **AUGMENTED** asset
> You are equipped with an advanced prosthetic, implant, or mechanical enhancement. When you make a move directly aided by the augment, envision how it gives you exceptional capabilities and add +1. On a strong hit with a match, your augment exceeds expectations; take +2 momentum. On a miss with a match, the augment is broken; you must **Repair** and spend 3 repair points to bring it back to working condition.
 
The Augmented asset definitely could be useful for combat. I start with one augment and can later upgrade for a second one. so possibly Winter Soldier-vibes or pre-Flashpoint Roy Harper.

> **MERCENARY** asset
> When you agree to wage war or defend others from war in exchange for payment or promises, you may **Swear an Iron Vow** to see the mission done. If you do, reroll any dice. When you **Fulfill Your Vow**, make the legacy reward one rank higher (1 extra box if already epic).

The Mercenary asset can also lead to interesting narrative choices later on.


>[!oracle] Backstory Prompts
>Dice Roll: **16** 
> Result: *You are haunted by past actions or failures.*

A super-soldier with a past guilt!

>[!oracle] Background Vow
> I threw *Eliminate* as Action and *Spirit* as Theme. I am refraining from choosing a background vow. I will swear this as the story progresses.


Next up was choosing the starship. I used the Stargazer Starship oracles to roll me a starship and I got the following rolls:


>[!oracle] Starship Oracles
>**Name**: Stellar Hawk
>**Class:** Unusual or unknown  
**Initial Contact:** Friendly  
**History:** Found abandoned in perfect condition
**Starship Character:** Hull is fused with organic growths
**First Look:** Dark or stealthy, Modern or advanced design 
**Mission:** Test a technology

So Vuldar Jensen's ship is called the Stellar Hawk. The rest of the details are interesting and lead to a lot of questions that can be fleshed out in game play or narrative.

Starforged give me an option to choose a final asset in addition to the path ones I picked up earlier. 

> OVERSEER asset
> Your AI module keeps watch over the vehicle's systems and sensor data. When you **Secure an Advantage** or **Gain Ground** by talking through a situation with the overseer, you may roll +integrity. If you do, take +1 momentum on a hit.

I choose the Overseer asset for two main reasons: One being that my starship is supposedly a test machine for a new technology and is of a modern/advanced design, it would have an AI module to take care of things. Second, my AI truth permits an advanced AI.

I next gave Vuldar Jensen the following stats:

[Edge:: 3]
[Heart:: 1]
[Iron:: 2]
[Shadow:: 1]
[Wits:: 2]

Vuldar is a super-soldier; so he has to be quick and agile and fast thinking. so I maxed his Edge and loaded his Iron and Wits stats. 

Now, I have to set up his condition meters as they track Vuldar's readiness and status. Since this is the first gameplay, I'm setting this to the default ones.

[Health:: 5]
[Spirit:: 5]
[Supply:: 5]
[Wealth:: 0]
[Momentum:: 2]

We've got our world truths and our [[Vuldar Jensen|player character]] all set.
