# Triggers by Marshall Goldsmith

## Summary

Understanding how our environment triggers us to act positively or negatively will help us to change and ensure our habits stick.

## Key Ideas

- Our environment is the biggest triggering mechanism that undermines our efforts to be a better person.
- Create a set of active **Engaging Questions** - questions that we ask ourselves if we **tried** to do our best.
	- The **Daily Questions** technique can help act as a commitment device by ensuring we stay on track.
	- You can make an **Hourly Questions** also if you are looking for a short-term benefit.
- The **AIWATT** question can help us overcome the triggers in our life.
	- *Am I willing, at this time, to make the investment required to make a positive difference on this topic?*
	- We are *superior planners* and *inferior doer*s. So we need a *coach* in our lives to bridge the gap.
