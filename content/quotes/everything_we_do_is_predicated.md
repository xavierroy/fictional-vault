There are those who say that all crimes can be ascribed to one of two motives – love or money – but I don’t believe that. In my experience, everything we do is predicated on one of two other things: greed or fear. Oh, sometimes they get mixed up, just like my brandy and milk, but mostly you can keep them separated. We feel greed for what we don’t have, and fear because of what we might lose. A man desires a woman who isn’t his wife, and takes her – that’s greed. But, deep down, he doesn’t want his own wife to find out because he wants to keep what he has with her, because it’s different, and safe.
