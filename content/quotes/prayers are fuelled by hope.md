It is said that prayers give the stars their light. Prayer is a natural thing for a human, like hope. Some say that prayers are fuelled by hope. Others say they are fuelled by greed, fear, or even evil, but ask any god, and they will tell you that hope is what fuels prayer. Prayer may be natural for humans, but hope is as foreign to the ghostly void above as sunlight or grass or birdsong. But despite this, the gods collect their prayers, sometimes whispered, sometimes shouted, sometimes wept, from the thick darkness, and in turn those prayers give them something that one might have dared to call hope. It gives them skin and bone.
