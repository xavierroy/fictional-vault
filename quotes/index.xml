Knowledge may hinder. Ignorance may liberate. Knowing when to know and when not to know, this is as important as a fluent blade.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/a-preordained-path/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/a-preordained-path/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;a preordained path&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-03-26T15:51:25+05:30 authors: [[Kate Mosse]] book: [[Labyrinth]] tags: #destiny #fate #superstition
If we are simply walking a path preordained, then all the experiences that make us who we are - love, grief, joy, learning, changing - would count for nothing.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/a-secrets-worth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/a-secrets-worth/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;a secret&amp;rsquo;s worth&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-04-01T16:02:03+05:30 authors: [[Carlos Ruis Zafon]] book: [[The Shadow of the Wind]] tags: #secrets

All she has left is the picture. Also the story of it. The picture is of happiness, the story not. Happiness is a garden walled with glass: there&amp;rsquo;s no way in or out. In Paradise there are no stories, because there are no journeys. It&amp;rsquo;s loss and regret and misery and yearning that drive the story forward, along its twisted road.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/absence-of-light/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/absence-of-light/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;absence of light&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-08-30T11:12:43+05:30 authors: [[Margaret Atwood]] book: [[The Blind Assassin]] tags: #darkness #light #writing
I look back over what I&amp;rsquo;ve written and I know it&amp;rsquo;s wrong, not because of what I&amp;rsquo;ve set down, but because of what I&amp;rsquo;ve omitted. What isn&amp;rsquo;t there has a presence, like the absence of light.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/against-all-odds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/against-all-odds/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;against all odds&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-08-29T10:30:07+05:30 authors: [[Margaret Atwood]] book: [[The Blind Assassin]] tags: #hope #miracle #perseverance
Thrown over a precipice, you fall or else you fly, you clutch at any hope, however unlikely; however - if I may use such an overworked word - miraculous.

It was easy to pretend that all was right with the world.

All men lie when they are afraid. Some tell many lies, some but a few. Some have only one great lie they tell so often that they almost come to believe it . . . though some small part of them will always know that it is still a lie, and that will show upon their faces.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/always_a_contest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/always_a_contest/</guid><description>book: [[Colours in the Steel]] authors: [[K.

I wonder which is preferable, to walk around all your life swollen up with your own secrets until you burst from the pressure of them, or to have them sucked out of you, every paragraph, every sentence, every word of them, so at the end you&amp;rsquo;re depleted of all that was once as precious to you as hoarded gold, as close to you as your skin - everything that was of the deepest importance to you, everything that made you cringe and wish to conceal, everything that belonged to you alone - and must spend the rest of your days like an empty sack flapping in the wind, an empty sack branded with a bright fluorescent label so that everyone will know what sort of secrets used to be inside you?</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/appearances-are/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/appearances-are/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;appearances are&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-04-21T16:26:02+05:30 authors: [[Terry Goodkind]] book: [[Chainfire]] tags: #appearances #representations
Appearance, after all, was a reflection of what a person thought of themselves and therefore, by extension, of others. A person crippled by self-loathing or self-doubt reflected those feelings in their appearance. Such visual clues did not inspire confidence in others because, and while not always completely accurate, for the most part they did reflect the inner person-whether or not that person realized it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/arguments-and-results/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/arguments-and-results/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;arguments and results&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-06-23T16:35:04+05:30 authors: [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] book: [[Red Mars]] tags: #arguments #judgments #listening
The only part of an argument that really matters is what we think of the people arguing. X claims a, Y claims b. They make arguments to support their claims with any number of points. But when their listeners remember the discussion, what matters is simply that X believes a and Y believes b.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/ashes-drift-afar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/ashes-drift-afar/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;ashes drift afar&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-08-27T16:46:25+05:30 authors: [[Margaret Atwood]] book: [[The Blind Assassin]] tags: #war

I learned as I grew up, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that being a friend is to like a person for who they are, even the parts you don&amp;rsquo;t understand. The reasons you like them makes the things you don&amp;rsquo;t understand unimportant. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to understand, or do the same, or live their lives for them. If you truly care for them, then you want them to be who you are; that was why you liked them in the first place.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/books-are-enchanted-wardrobes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/books-are-enchanted-wardrobes/</guid><description>authors = [[Joe Hill]] book = [[Full Throttle]] date = 2020-09-09T11:30:00Z tags = #magic #books title = &amp;ldquo;books are enchanted wardrobes&amp;rdquo;
I also still believe that books operate along the same principles as enchanted wardrobes.

He would die without fear, drenched in his own heart&amp;rsquo;s blood, in the embrace of a beautiful woman, and she would weep for him.

The notion that any one person can describe ‘what really happened' is an absurdity. If ten &amp;quot; or a hundred &amp;quot; people witness an event, there will be ten &amp;quot; or a hundred &amp;quot; different versions of what took place. What we see and how we interpret it depends entirely upon our individual past experience.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/destiny-doesnt-do-home-visits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/destiny-doesnt-do-home-visits/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;destiny doesn&amp;rsquo;t do home visits&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-04-01T16:04:11+05:30 authors: Carlos Ruis Zafon book: The Shadow of the Wind tags: [&amp;ldquo;destiny&amp;rdquo;]
Destiny is usually around the corner. Like a thief, like a hooker, or a lottery vendor: its three most common personifications. But what destiny does not do is home visits. You have to go for it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/disguise-of-evil/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/disguise-of-evil/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;disguise of evil&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-01-28T14:46:10+05:30 authors: [[Terry Goodkind]] book: [[The Pillars of Creation]] tags: #evil
Evil thinks not to beguile us by unveiling the terrible truth of its festering intent, but comes, instead, disguised in the diaphanous robes of a virtue, whispering sweet-sounding lies intended to seduce us into the dark bed of our eternal graves.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/displacing-copernicus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/displacing-copernicus/</guid><description>title: displacing Copernicus date: 2020-09-12 authors: [[John Connolly]] book: [[A Time of Torment]] tags: #ego

If you always do the easier thing, then you cannot possibly remain steadfast when it becomes necessary to take a difficult stand. You must do what you know to be right. And you do know. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred you do know and you are just making excuses because the right thing is so hard, or just inconvenient.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/dreams_of_rich_and_poor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/dreams_of_rich_and_poor/</guid><description>author: [[Glen Cook]] book: [[Water Sleeps]] tags: #dreams #rich #poor

There is an ebb and flow in all human events, there is a building up and a tearing down, there are brief enchanted moments in history and in the short lives of men and women, there is wonder and there is cynicism, there are dreams that can come true, and dreams that can&amp;rsquo;t.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/elections-are/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/elections-are/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;elections are&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-01-31T15:02:39+05:30 authors: [[David Eddings]] book: [[Polgara the Sorceress]] tags: #ability #elections

Continous expansion is a fundamental tenet of economics. Therefore one of the fundamentals of the universe itself. Because everything is economics.

There are those who say that all crimes can be ascribed to one of two motives – love or money – but I don’t believe that. In my experience, everything we do is predicated on one of two other things: greed or fear. Oh, sometimes they get mixed up, just like my brandy and milk, but mostly you can keep them separated.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/evil_in_the_name_of_righteousness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/evil_in_the_name_of_righteousness/</guid><description>author: [[Glen Cook]] book: [[Dreams of Steel]] tags: #evil #righteousness

Every person&amp;rsquo;s life is theirs by right. An individual&amp;rsquo;s life can and must belong only to himself, not to any society or community, or he is then but a slave.

The most fiendish of men, the most cowardly, none of them think of them as villains. They believe themselves to be heroes, accomplishing impossible tasks against overwhelming opposition.
They convince themselves of this by seeing only what they wish to see, robbing words of their message, forgetting the real and remembering the false.

There&amp;rsquo;s a peculiar dichotomy in the nature of almost anyone who calls himself a historian.

All his life he&amp;rsquo;d dealt in honour and service, the way a furrier deals in furs or a vintner in wine.

Now, unfortunately a little bit too late, he&amp;rsquo;d been granted a little gleam of insight; service is what makes you stand in the line when nobody would try and stop you if you ran away, and honour is what&amp;rsquo;s left when every other conceivable reason for staying there has long since evaporated.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/how_things_are_perceived/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/how_things_are_perceived/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;how things are perceived&amp;rdquo; date: 2005-12-13T14:25:43+05:30 authors:[[James J Gibson]] book: [[The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception]] tags: #perceptions

Love is a passion for life shared with another person. You fall in love with a person who you think is wonderful.

Mythical figures live many lives, die many deaths, and in this they differ from the characters we find in novels, who can never go beyond the single gesture.

No religion I ever encountered made any sense. None are consistent. Most gods are megalomaniacs and paranoid psychotics by their worshipers’ description.

What you see isn&amp;rsquo;t always the reality. We look at one thing but see another. Why? With a marble statue because of a change in perspective or trick of light. But with human beings, the reasons are more complex. People project only what they want others to see, or atleast they try to. And even when unintended clues to the being behind the mask are exposed, we often refuse to see them.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/nothing_dries_more_quickly_than_a_tear/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/nothing_dries_more_quickly_than_a_tear/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;nothing dries quickly&amp;rdquo; date: 2007-04-14T16:02:28+05:30 authors: [[Thomas Harris]] book: [[Imperium]] tags: #tears

It is said that prayers give the stars their light. Prayer is a natural thing for a human, like hope. Some say that prayers are fuelled by hope. Others say they are fuelled by greed, fear, or even evil, but ask any god, and they will tell you that hope is what fuels prayer. Prayer may be natural for humans, but hope is as foreign to the ghostly void above as sunlight or grass or birdsong.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/presuming_god/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/presuming_god/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;presuming god&amp;rdquo; date: 2007-06-11T16:08:51+05:30 authors: [[Richard Dawkins]] book: [[The God Delusion]] tags: #god #atheism

They were the people who thought it was a good idea to kill people who looked or acted differently against the people who didn’t.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/tyranny_cannot_endure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/tyranny_cannot_endure/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;tyranny cannot endure&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-02-14T15:27:23+05:30 authors: [[Terry Goodkind]] book: [[Naked Empire]] tags: #tyranny
Tyranny cannot endure forever. By its very nature it rots everything it rules, including itself.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/victims_of_our_imaginations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/victims_of_our_imaginations/</guid><description>author: [[Glen Cook]] book: [[Bleak Seasons]] tags: #imaginations

War was beautiful, when you had the good fortune not to be engaged in it. It was sound and fury, colour and movement, a massed assault on the senses. It was bravura and theatrical, something that made you gasp. It was thrilling and romantic, when you were a spectator.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/we_base_our_intelligence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/we_base_our_intelligence/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;we base our intelligence&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-01-05T17:00:09+05:30 authors: [[David Eddings]] book: [[Belgarath the Sorceror]] tags: [&amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;commonality&amp;rdquo;]
Have you ever noticed that? We base our assessment of the intelligence of others almost entirely on how closely their thinking matches our own. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that there are people out there who violently disagree with me on most things, and I&amp;rsquo;m broad-minded enough to concede that they might possibly not be complete idiots, but I much prefer the company of people who agree with me.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/what_is_history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/what_is_history/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;what is history&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-12-15T12:16:52+05:30 authors: [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]] book: [[The Tyrant]] tags: #history
History is the story of humanity, filtered by the intelligence of people who have the understanding. And history goes where it wants, Dionysius, like an enormous river that sometimes flows with unstoppable strength, overwhelming everything in its path, and that sometimes advances slowly in lazy spirals waiting to be subdued and controlled by the most mediocre of men.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/what_is_real/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/what_is_real/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;what is real&amp;rdquo; date: 2007-07-17T12:59:55+05:30 authors: [[Takashi Matsuoka]] book: [[Cloud of Sparrows]] tags: #death #life
What is the real? When the blades of your enemies are slashing ferociously at you, and your life hangs in the balance, you will know.
If you do not, you have lived your life in vain.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/who_counts_on_the_aid_of_a_god/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/who_counts_on_the_aid_of_a_god/</guid><description>author: [[Glen Cook]] book: [[Dreams of Steel]] tags: #god

Words can damage. Silence can heal. Knowing when to speak and when not to speak is the wisdom of sages.
Knowledge can hinder. Ignorance can liberate. Knowing when to know and when not to know is the wisdom of prophets.
Unimpeded by words, silence, knowledge, or ignorance, a fluent blade cuts cleanly.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/world_and_boundaries/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/world_and_boundaries/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;world and boundaries&amp;rdquo; date: 2005-12-01T21:23:54+05:30 authors: [[Terry Brooks]] book: [[The Scions of Shannara]] tags: #life #challenge
We cannot pretend that the world begins and ends at the boundaries we might make for it. Sometimes, we acknowledge that it extends itself into our lives in ways that we might prefer it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t, and we must face up to the challenges it offers.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/writing_the_truth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/writing_the_truth/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;writing the truth&amp;rdquo; date: 2006-08-29T10:09:01+05:30 authors: [[Margaret Atwood]] book: [[The Blind Assassin]] tags: #excuses #truth #writing
The only way you can write the truth is to assume that what you set down will never be read. Not by any other person, and not even by yourself at some later date. Otherwise you begin excusing yourself.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/yearning_and_spirituality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/yearning_and_spirituality/</guid><description>authors = [[Joe Hill]] book = [[Full Throttle]] date = 2020-09-09T12:30:00Z tags = #spirituality #religion title = &amp;ldquo;yearning and spirituality&amp;rdquo;
Ancient religions used to tell people that letting go of yearning is the highest form of spirituality. But Buddha had it wrong. Yearning is the difference between being human and being a Clockwork. Not to want is not to live. Even DNA is an engine of desire—driven to copy itself over and over.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/you_cannot_control_everything/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xavierroy.github.io/fictional-vault/quotes/you_cannot_control_everything/</guid><description>title: &amp;ldquo;you cannot control everything&amp;rdquo; date: 2020-09-09T15:43:07+05:30 authors: [[Viktor Frankel]] book: [[Man&amp;rsquo;s Search for Meaning]] tags: #control #fate
